    "# Lesson 4: File Handling\n",

    "File handling is an essential part of any programming language, including Python. It involves opening, reading, writing, and closing files. In Python, you can perform file handling operations using built-in functions and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and Writing to Files:\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions to open, read, write, and close files. You can use the open() function to open a file in different modes, such as 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, and 'a' for appending."
