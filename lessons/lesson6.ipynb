    "# Lesson 6: Web Development using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development using Python refers to the process of building web applications or websites using the Python programming language. Python is a high-level, general-purpose language with a simple syntax, making it easy to learn and use. With its vast library of web frameworks and tools, Python has become a popular choice for web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to web development with Python\n",
    "Web development with Python involves the use of web frameworks such as Flask, Django, Pyramid, and many others. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and efficiently. Python also has libraries for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the basic building blocks of web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flask web framework\n",
    "Flask is a popular web framework in Python, known for its simplicity and flexibility. It is a lightweight framework that does not require any particular tools or libraries, making it easy to set up and get started with. Flask provides built-in support for handling requests and responses, routing, and templating. It also has a wide range of extensions and plugins, which make it easy to add features such as authentication, database connectivity, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a basic web application using Flask\n",
    "To create a basic web application using Flask, you first need to install Flask on your system. You can install it using pip, a package manager for Python. Once installed, you can create a basic Flask application with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n"

    "In this example, we import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class. We then define a route using the @app.route() decorator, which tells Flask what URL to respond to. Finally, we define a function that returns a string, which is displayed in the web browser when the user visits the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this application, you simply need to save the code to a file (e.g., app.py) and run it from the command line using the python command:\n",
    "\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the Flask development server, which listens for requests on the default port (usually 5000). You can then visit the URL http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to see the \"Hello, World!\" message.\n",

    "In conclusion, web development using Python involves the use of web frameworks such as Flask to create web applications and websites quickly and efficiently.
